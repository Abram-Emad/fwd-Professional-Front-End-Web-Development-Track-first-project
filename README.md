# Landing Page Project:-

This is my first landing page project and I hope that I have been able to implement all that was required in this project in the best possible way

## Features:-

- I created my Landing Page Project concept design about a page for selling coffee and I made the whole html and css files with myself.
- I created a function to generate li and inseret them under the empety ul `that exsisting in the html file`.
- I created a an addeventlistener to let the user moving around the sections dynamically using the navigation bar.
- I created a function to add an active class to any link in the navigation bar when clicking on it and to add active class to any section you go to through the navigation bar or while scrolling `using this active class to chang the background of the section`.
- I made an icon to go to the top of the page.
